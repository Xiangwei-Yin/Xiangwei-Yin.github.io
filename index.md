School of Physics, Chongqing University.

## Personal Information
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Chongqing University(CQU). 
I got my Bachelor's degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2017, and then finished my Master's degree at Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science (IHEP,CAS) in 2020. I completed my Ph.D. at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science ( ITP,CAS ) in 2024.

## Research

 I am interested in new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics (or so called High Energy Physics), including String model, either Supersymmetrical (SUSY) or non-SUSY model and their phenomenology.

 I am working on the topic of Graviational Waves (GWs) physics as well, for instance, the GWs induced by the topolotical defects and the  first order phase transition.

 In addition, I will also investigate the topic on axion physics, the cosmic inflation, and black hole physics in the future.  

 Here is my [INSPIRE profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2010288).

## Interest

> What do we mean when we say that we are interested in something? To what extent can we classify a behavior as an interest? That's tricky. Therefore, i intend to clarify that it is qualified if you have the will to touch something. 
>
> I need to update my perspective now. My understanding of interest is that it means you hope to achieve a professional level through effort. (2024.11)
>
> I will undate this part in the future...

I am a fan of classical music. Now i am learing how to perform a tolerable noise on the violin and i think the things will go better (some of the naive recordings are in preparation). Besides, i have enthusiasm on poetry, philosophy, psychology, history, and economics. The computer science attracts me as well.
