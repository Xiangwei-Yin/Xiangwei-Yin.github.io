## Personal Information
I am currently a PH.D. candidate at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science( ITP,CAS ).


## Research
 I am interested in particle physics, cosmology, etc.
 
 Here are my preprints.
 
 [The general $U(1)_{X}$ Models Inspired from SO(10)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03878). 
 
 [Explanations of the Tentative New Physics Anomalies and Dark Matter in the Simple Extension of the Standard Model (SESM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08215).

## Interest

I am a fan of classical music. Now i am learing how to perform a tolerable noise on the violin and i think the things will go better.

## Miscellaneous
### Computer tools in high energy physics and cosmology  i am learning
