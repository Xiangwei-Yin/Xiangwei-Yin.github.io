## Personal Information
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Science ( ITP,CAS ).
I got my Bachelor Degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) in 2017, and then finished my Master Degree at Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science (IHEP,CAS) in 2020.

## Research
 I am interested in particle physics (or so called High Energy Physics), cosmology (especially inflation), black hole physics, etc. 
 
 Here are my preprints and my [INSPIRE profile](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2010288)
 
 [The general $U(1)_{X}$ Models Inspired from SO(10)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03878). 
 
 [Explanations of the Tentative New Physics Anomalies and Dark Matter in the Simple Extension of the Standard Model (SESM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08215).

## Interest
What do we mean when we say that we are interested in something? To what extent can we classify a behavior as an interest? That's tricky. Therefore, i intend to clarify that it is qualified if you have the will to touch something. 

I am a fan of classical music. Now i am learing how to perform a tolerable noise on the violin and i think the things will go better (some of the naive recordings are in preparation). Besides, i have enthusiasm on poetry, philosophy, psychology, history, and economics. The computer languages like C++ and Python attracted me as well.
